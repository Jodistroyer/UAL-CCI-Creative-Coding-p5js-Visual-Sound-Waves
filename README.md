# Dynamic Wave Visualization with Music

This project combines music playback with dynamic wave visualization using p5.js. It analyzes the frequency spectrum of a loaded audio file in real-time and creates a mesmerizing visual representation that pulsates with the music.

## Features
- Real-time analysis of frequency spectrum using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
- Dynamic wave visualization that responds to the music's bass, mid, and treble frequencies
- Trailing effect achieved with a low alpha background
- Interactive start: press the mouse to begin music playback and visualization

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the source files.
2. Place your desired music file (in .mp3 format) in the project directory and name it `music.mp3`.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
4. Click and hold the mouse to start the music playback and visualize the dynamic wave.

## Customization
- Adjust the alpha value increment in the `draw()` function to control the fading effect.
- Experiment with the `map()` function parameters in the `drawDynamicWave()` function to modify the wave's behavior and appearance.
- Explore additional p5.js features to add more visual elements or effects.

## Dependencies
- p5.js: A JavaScript library for creative coding, providing a full set of drawing functionality.
